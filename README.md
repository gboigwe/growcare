# 🔵 GrowCare - Where care flows in circles

*Care-centered expense sharing built on Stacks Bitcoin L2. Fair, transparent, and warm.*

**Care flows in circles.** ✨

Built for the **Stacks Vibe Coding Hackathon 2025** 🏆

## 🌟 What is GrowCare?

GrowCare transforms expense sharing from tracking debts into flowing care. Instead of "you owe Alice $50," we recognize that communities operate in **circles of mutual care**—everyone contributes when they can, everyone receives when they need, and support comes full circle.

Built on Stacks Bitcoin L2 with Clarity smart contracts, GrowCare combines blockchain transparency with human warmth. Every contribution is secured, every moment of care is permanent, and every interaction feels like what it truly is: **caring for each other.**

## 💝 **GrowCare Brand Philosophy**

GrowCare embodies four core pillars:

### 🌊 **Warm & Flowing**
*"Care flows in circles."* Support moves naturally through the community, like water finding its course.

### 🔵 **Clear & Balanced**
*"Fair as a circle."* Everyone equal distance from center. Transparency and fairness build trust.

### 💪 **Empowering & Inclusive**
*"Everyone belongs in the circle."* No outsiders. Everyone feels valued and empowered.

### 🎯 **Humble but Purposeful**
*"Quietly keeping care flowing."* We solve real problems without fanfare.

**Design Language**: Teal (flow) + purple (care) gradients. Flowing animations make interactions feel alive. Every word choice reinforces that this is about **care flowing**, not debt tracking.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Clarity contracts are decidable and safer than Solidity
- Only circle keepers can invite members
- Care settlements require exact amounts
- All transactions are transparent on Bitcoin L2
- Records are permanent and secured by Bitcoin

---

## 🌐 Deployment

### Frontend
The frontend can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Vercel (recommended)
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run start # Production server
```

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

This project was built for the **Stacks Vibe Coding Hackathon 2025** with focus on:
- Consumer-facing blockchain applications
- Human-centered Web3 UX
- Clarity smart contract innovation
- Real-world social utility

### Key Innovation: Circular Care Model

GrowCare introduces a **circular reciprocity model** that transforms expense tracking from:
- ❌ Linear debts (A owes B, B owes C)
- ✅ Circular care flows (everyone → circle → everyone)

This isn't just semantic—it's a fundamental reframe of how communities support each other.

## 💙 **About This Project**

GrowCare was born from a simple belief: **care works best when it flows in circles, not lines.**

Traditional expense apps track debts. GrowCare tracks how care circulates through your community—fair, transparent, continuous. We chose Stacks Bitcoin L2 because **care this important deserves Bitcoin security.**

Every gradient, every animation, every word is chosen to remind us that behind every wallet address is a human heart. Blockchain's greatest power isn't its technology—it's its ability to help us trust and care for each other.

*Care flows in circles.* 🔵✨
